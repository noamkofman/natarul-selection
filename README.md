This program is a simualtion of natarul selection. The simulation has 4 blobs forced to eat orange cubes, if they eat, then they reproduce. Every blob has a random chance of developing the speed mutation. If a parent has the mutation and reproduces then it has a higher chance of giving it to the offsrpring
